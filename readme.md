In combination with my-json-server.typicode.com, this repo functions as an indirect API.

For example, try visting: 

You'll see that there we receive percl sourced from json objects here.

This is great for example applications that rely on assumed responses. For example, setting up call 
forwarding for a franchise, and assuming they have some existing locations. "Existing location" PerCL will be defined
statically here, and associated with a number + application on an existing vail account.

This allows new users to create examples with hardcoded phone numbers for things like voice mail boxes etc, 
with no cost of an API.

Additionally, if your application is completely static, you could host your entire FreeClimb application out of a 
github repo like this just by writing PerCL response objects with no code.
